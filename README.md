Absolutely! Here's a **C++ Function Documentation Cheat Sheet** with both common and occasionally used tags to help you document your code in a clear, structured, and tool-friendly way (especially for tools like **Doxygen**).

## üßæ C++ Function Documentation Cheat Sheet

Use this structure in comment blocks before your function definitions:

```cpp
/**
 * @brief   [Short summary of what the function does.]
 *
 * @details [Optional longer explanation of logic, edge cases, or implementation.]
 *
 * @param   [name] [Description of this parameter. Include type expectations, ranges, or units if useful.]
 * @return  [Return value description, or "void" if nothing.]
 *
 * @pre     [What must be true before calling (preconditions).]
 * @post    [What is guaranteed after the function finishes.]
 * @throws  [Exceptions or error conditions (if applicable).]
 * @retval  [Alternative to @return for specifying return codes or conditions.]
 * @see     [Other related functions or references.]
 * @note    [Special notes for developers or future maintainers.]
 * @warning [Important edge cases, behavior, or risks.]
 * @bug     [Known issues with the function.]
 * @todo    [Planned improvements or refactoring.]
 * @deprecated [Use if this function is outdated or has a better alternative.]
 */

## ‚úÖ Commonly Used Tags

| Tag       | Purpose                                                  |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@brief`  | One-line summary of the function                         |
| `@param`  | Describes a function parameter                           |
| `@return` | Describes the return value                               |
| `@pre`    | Preconditions (must be true before calling the function) |
| `@post`   | Postconditions (guarantees after function call)          |

## üîç Optional But Helpful Tags

| Tag           | Purpose                                                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `@details`    | Longer explanation of logic, performance, or context                     |
| `@throws`     | What exceptions or errors might be thrown                                |
| `@retval`     | Like @return, but better for enums or status codes                       |
| `@see`        | Cross-references to related functions or documents                       |
| `@note`       | Extra information that isn‚Äôt critical but might help developers          |
| `@warning`    | Behavior that might surprise users (e.g. side effects, weird edge cases) |
| `@bug`        | Known problems or limitations                                            |
| `@todo`       | Future work or areas to improve                                          |
| `@deprecated` | Marks the function as obsolete and suggests an alternative               |

## ‚úçÔ∏è Example: Full Comment Block

```cpp
/**
 * @brief   Moves the snake one step in its current direction.
 *
 * @details This function updates the internal snake position by retrieving
 *          its current direction and moving it accordingly. It wraps around
 *          the screen edges if necessary.
 *
 * @param row  Current row of the snake head (0 <= row < ROW).
 * @param col  Current column of the snake head (0 <= col < COL).
 * @return     A pair (row, col) with the new head position.
 *
 * @pre        The snake direction must be between 1 and 4.
 * @post       The returned position will always be within grid bounds.
 * @see        Snake::get_direction()
 * @todo       Add diagonal movement in future versions.
 */
std::pair<int, int> point_from_direction(int row, int col);
